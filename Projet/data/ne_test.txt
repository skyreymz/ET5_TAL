Mary Barra appointed as General Motors chief
December 10, 2013
The United States 's largest car manufacturer General Motors today named Mary Barra as its new chief executive.
Barra, 51, will be the first woman to lead a firm in the American auto industry.
She has been with General Motors for 33 years, and is currently the global head of product development.
She said in a statement : `` With an amazing portfolio of cars and trucks and the strongest financial performance in our recent history, this is an exciting time at today 's GM.
I' m honored to lead the best team in the business and to keep our momentum at full speed. ''
She replaces Daniel Akerson, who was appointed by the government as both chief executive and chairman in 2009 during the company 's bankruptcy.
Akerson plans to stand down on January 15 following his wife 's advanced cancer diagnosis.
In a message to employees, he said : `` I will leave with great satisfaction in what we have accomplished, great optimism over what is ahead and great pride that we are restoring General Motors as America 's standard bearer in the global auto industry. ''
Akerson will also relinquish his chairman role, to be replaced by current director Theodore Solso.
The company also announced head of finance Daniel Ammann as its new president.
The appointment comes just days after the US government sold the last of its shares in the company, losing around $ 9 billion on its initial bailout in 2008 that saw 61 % of the firm coming under public ownership.
General Motors recovered from their bankruptcy a year after the appointment of Akerson, and re-entered the stock market in November 2010.
It remains the largest car manufacturer in the United States, posting sales figures of $ 152 billion in 2012.
It currently produces fifteen brands of vehicle in 37 countries.
Barra holds a bachelor 's degree in electrical engineering from Kettering University in Flint, Michigan, and was recently listed by Forbes as the 35th most powerful woman in the world.
US automaker bailout deal fails to pass Senate
December 12, 2008
A US$ 14 billion bailout package deal for the `` Big Three '' United States automakers -- Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors -- has been rejected in the United States Senate after failing a procedural vote.
The bill was rejected after bipartisan discussions on the bailout broke down when Republican Party leaders insisted that the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union agree to increase wage cuts by next year in order to bring their pay into line with those of Japanese automobile companies in the United States.
The UAW refused to meet the demands.
The final vote count in the Senate was 52-35, eight short of the 60 needed to pass.
Only ten Republicans joined forty Democrats and two independents in voting for the bill.
Three Democrats voted with thirty-one Republicans against it.
Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said that he was `` terribly disappointed '' by the failure of the bill to pass.
`` I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow.
It 's not going to be a pleasant sight, '' Reid said.
`` Millions of Americans, not only the auto workers but people who sell cars, car dealerships, people who work on cars are going to be directly impacted and affected. ''
Republican Senator Bob Corker was also unhappy about the rejection.
`` We were about three words away from a deal.
We solved everything substantively and about three words keep us from reaching a conclusion, '' he said.
Some Democrats now want U.S. President Bush to reserve a portion of the $ 700 billion bailout package earmarked for Wall Street to assist the flagging car industry.
Stock markets worldwide fell dramatically on the news, with Japan 's Nikkei average losing 484.68 points, or 5.6 percent, reaching a level of 8253.87 points.
Shares in the auto companies Toyota, Nissan and Honda all dropped by no less than 10 percent apiece.
European stocks, such as those in the United Kingdom and Germany, also lost ground, with the FTSE-100 index of leading shares falling 176.3 points to a level of 4,211 at midday.
White House considering auto rescue plan
December 13, 2008
After a plan to bail out three large American auto companies failed to pass the Senate this week, the White House has said that it is considering using some of the US$ 700 billion earmarked to rescue the banking industry to bail out the automakers.
The White House says that the collapse of the automakers would be a terrible setback that could destroy the economy.
`` Under normal economic conditions we would prefer that markets determine the ultimate fate of private firms.
However, given the current weakened state of the US economy, we will consider other options if necessary - including use of the TARP Troubled Assets Relief Program ] programme - to prevent a collapse of troubled automakers, '' said Dana Perino, the White House Press Secretary.
`` A precipitous collapse of this industry would have a severe impact on our economy, and it would be irresponsible to further weaken and destabilize our economy at this time. ''
Earlier this week, the `` Big Three '' automakers - Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors - had pleaded before Congress to be given $ 14 billion in funds so as to prevent collapse.
Although the House approved the measures, the Senate voted the proposition down with a vote of 52-35.
Part of the failure of the bill to pass was due to disagreements over labour cuts, which the Republicans insisted reach parity by next year with those of Japanese carmakers.
General Motors stated that the company would stop 30 % of its North American production `` in response to rapidly deteriorating market conditions ''.
GM, Chrysler offer buyouts and early retirement to workers
February 3, 2009
General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler have both begun to offer layoff packages to their workforces.
The automobile manufacturers have been hard hit in the recent economic downturn and have been forced to seek federal aid from the U.S. government.
Reports say that GM 's package includes a $ 20 cash payment and a $ 25 new vehicle voucher.
Chrysler will offer a $ 25 vehicle voucher and $ 50 with healthcare and $ 75 without.
Both will offer the deal to most United Auto Workers ( UAW ) union members - 62 at GM, which is seeking to cut 31,5 jobs by 2012.
The two companies have received $ 13.4 billion in federal loans to keep them operating, but Congress required them to produce viability plans to demonstrate they were making significant cost cuts and labor concessions in return for the money.
UAW workers in Detroit earn $ 28 an hour ";" their replacements will earn about half that.
The UAW 's `` jobs bank '', a system where workers without duties are still paid, has stopped at both companies.
GM is also attempting to engineer a debt-for-equity swap, reducing its liabilities from $ 27.5 billion in unsecured debt to $ 9.2 billion.
It is also seeking to sell a truck manufacturer, the Delco Electronics parts group and the Hummer and Saab Automobile vehicle brands.
The entire motor manufacturing sector has suffered under the economic downturn, with the Ford Motor Company announcing a $ 14.6 billion annual loss, although it has not sought federal aid.
GM and Chrysler both ran out of operating funds in December, leading to the federal bailout.
Automobile sales in the United States down sharply
February 3, 2009
Sales of automobiles in the United States fell as much as 35 % in January, compared to the same month a year ago, as manufacturers reported their January sales.
Ford Motor Company sales dropped 42 % last month from the previous year.
General Motors reported a 49 % decline.
Chrysler was hardest hit among the domestically owned manufacturers with a plunge of 55 %.
The decline in sales has not been limited to just US manufacturers.
Japanese automaker Toyota reported a 32 % drop in US sales from a year earlier, Nissan Motors dropped 30 %, and Honda sales dropped 28 %.
Subaru and South Korean Hyundai Motor Company were two of the few auto firms that reported an increase in sales.
They posted gains of eight and fourteen percent, respectively.
On an annual basis, sales overall have also been plummeting.
Industry-wide US car sales dropped 18 % last year to 13.2 million automobiles.
GM announced today that it will offer voluntary buyouts to 22 employees in the US, in an effort to reduce its expenditures.
Last month, GM and Chrysler were given loans worth US$ 17.4 billion from the government after they warned of imminent bankruptcy.
US automakers GM and Chrysler seek more government aid
February 18, 2009
The United States auto manufacturer Chrysler, which has been badly affected by the ongoing recession, has asked the US government for an additional US$ 5 billion in aid on top of the four billion it has already received, saying that it plans to fire three thousand employees.
At the end of last year, the auto maker had just over 54 employees, meaning that the layoffs will equal about six percent of its total workforce.
In addition, Chrysler will cut the Chrysler Aspen, PT Cruiser, and Durango from production.
Another automaker, General Motors ( GM ), announced that it seeks $ 16.6 billion in loans from the government, in addition to the $ 13.4 billion that it has already received.
GM plans to lay off 47 employees and close five factories.
GM says that it might need as much as $ 30 billion from the US Treasury Department, an increase over their previous estimate of $ 18 billion.
The company has warned that it might run out of money by March if more aid was not given.
Rick Wagoner, GM 's chief executive, described the firm 's plan as `` comprehensive, responsive, achievable, and flexible ''.
`` We have a lot of work in front of us, but I am confident it will result in a profitable General Motors, '' he said, adding that `` today 's plan is significantly more aggressive because it has to be. ''
GM says that it could be profitable in two years ' time, and might be able to repay all its loans by 2017.
A third US car manufacturer, Ford Motor Company, has said that it can make it through this year without any government aid.
The US Treasury Department will review the car makers ' survival plans for several weeks before a decision is made on whether or not to extend the loans.
That decision is due by the end of next month.
GM and Chrysler receive Canadian loans amid US restructuring ultimata
April 3, 2009
General Motors ( GM ) and Chrysler will receive bridge loans from the government of Canada and the provincial government of Ontario, however no more will be forthcoming from either Canadian or US governments unless the companies can reinvent themselves.
`` This is a regrettable but necessary step to protect the Canadian economy.
We are doing this on the assumption that we obviously can not afford either in the United States or Canada a catastrophic short-term collapse. ''
said Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada.
`` We can not, we must not, and we will not let our auto industry simply vanish.
This industry is, like no other, an emblem of the American spirit ";" a once and future symbol of America 's success, '' said Barack Obama, President of the United States.
`` These companies - and this industry - must ultimately stand on their own, not as wards of the state. ''
Chrysler will receive CA$ 1 billion and may in fact be eligible for as much as CA$ 4 billion.
If Chrysler succeeds in the next 30 days with a restructuring plan it would be eligible for a US$ 6 billion loan.
A part of Chrysler 's restructuring plan must include a partnership with Fiat within 30 days to appease the US administration.
Fiat is a supplier of smaller fuel-efficient vehicles, and the merger will help Chrysler to be viable in the North American market.
A Chrysler court bankruptcy would inevitably lead to it being sold off.
As a part of Chrysler 's restructuring plans, Tom LaSorda, the president of Chrysler announced that Canadian operations would fold if it does not receive both the US commitment of $ 2.3 billion of aid and a new Canadian Auto Workers CAW contract to reduce all-in costs by CA$ 19 per hour.
As a result of this announcement Chrysler 's auto sales volume in Canada dropped 23 % compared to March of 2008.
GM has until the end of May to restructure its company to receive up to CA$ 7.5 billion.
As part of the companies restructuring, General Motor 's chief executive Rick Wagoner was replaced Sunday with Fritz Henderson, the current chief operating officer.
Henderson spoke out on Tuesday that GM has submitted a restructuring plan which would close five plants, and this may be increased to meet the requirements for financial aid.
He is in full compliance with Obama 's auto task force to seek bankruptcy if GM can not negotiate with their unions, bondholders and others.
GM recently brought forward the `` GM Total Confidence '' program providing consumer purchase protection for customers who lose their job for economic reasons within the first two years from purchase.
As a result of Chrysler 's restructuring announcement in Canada, GM 's Canadian vehicle sales volume fell only 17.3 % compared to 2008, an increase from the previous month.
GM must reduce some of its legacy costs which include its pensions and union health care costs.
A part of GM 's ailments arose from investing in supplying truck and SUVs during an economy of high gas prices when consumers were demanding fuel efficient vehicles.
Tony Clement, Canada 's Minister of Industry, is hoping that the CAW will support the restructuring process and re-negotiate their agreement.
Whereas a United Auto Workers negotiator has said, `` I do n't see how the UAW will do anything until they see what the bondholders will give up. ''
The Obama administration is looking toward bankruptcy proceedings for the automakers, `` as a mechanism to help them restructure quickly and emerge stronger.
It will ] quickly clear away old debts that are weighing them down.
What we are asking is difficult.
It will require hard choices by companies.
It will require unions and workers who have already made painful concessions to make even more.
It will require creditors to recognise that they can not hold out for the prospect of endless government bailouts. ''
said Obama.
The auto parts suppliers and IT software exporters in India have already been affected by the declining auto sales.
GM and Chrysler software contracts provide US$ 300 to 350 million a year to vendors in India.
As well these two major automakers usually award US$ 1 billion contracts to auto parts suppliers.
`` We are worried and closely watching the developments in the US to gauge the impact.
The decline in auto sales in the US has already hit the order books of Indian suppliers, '' said a Delhi auto parts supplier.
`` Going forward, the industry will undoubtedly be smaller, but if our efforts are successful it will be viable and it will support good jobs for Canadians, '' said Clements.
Betty Sutton, Ohio 's Congresswoman put forward the CARS act which provides a US$ 3 to 5 incentive for those who trade in their vehicle for a fuel-efficient car.
`` It clearly stimulates the economy, and it gets the consumer into the showroom and gets them buying again.
But importantly -- and this is what I particularly like about it -- it really helps the environment quite a bit in two respects. ''
said William Clay Ford Jr., executive chairman of Ford Motor Co..
Ford Motor Company has not come forward with requests for assistance.
Since December GM and Chrysler have received US$ 17.4 billion government loans.
General Motors automobile sales plunge by 45 %
April 1, 2009
General Motors Corporation ( GM ) announced on Wednesday that it saw a 45 % drop in United States vehicle sales for its cars in March.
Executives from several auto firms, however, said that there was some hope for the auto industry to stabilise, as car sales rebounded in the last week of March.
`` The market is starting to show small signs of life which need to be nourished like seedlings, '' said the vice president and chairman of Chrysler LLC Jim Press.
`` It 's too early to see a trend, but spring shows signs of hope. ''
Other automobile manufacturers also saw their car sales slip : Chrysler and the Japanese Toyota both reported a 39 % loss, whilst Ford Motor Company sales fell 41 %.
Annualised sales of vehicles in the car industry in the US are predicted to have dipped below nine million in March, compared to February 's 9.12 million, which was the lowest number since 1981.
`` Auto makers are pulling every lever in their effort to attract buyers, as evidenced by the new programs from Ford and GM.
The typical incentive programs simply do not resonate in today 's economy, '' Jesse Toprak, an analyst for Edmunds.
Ford shares gained 2.3 % to a level of US$ 2.69 in early trading at US stock markets on Wednesday, while stocks for Toyota 's US depository increased 5.9 % to $ 67.
GM shares slipped 1.6 % down to $ 1.92.
Chrysler files for bankruptcy, Fiat Group SpA to run company
May 1, 2009
The American auto company Chrysler filed for bankruptcy Thursday, however a deal with European auto maker Fiat went through.
The emerging Chrysler will be owned 55 percent by the United Auto Workers, eight percent by the United States Government, two percent by the Canadian Government and Fiat would begin with a 20 percent share.
Chrysler Chief Executive Robert Nardelli will step down when the bankruptcy proceedings are finalized.
Initially, the Italian company, Fiat, will appoint three members on the emerging Chrysler 's new board, and the United States government will appoint six.
Fiat can assume the majority of the ownership upon repayment of American loans.
Chrysler administrators expect that the bankruptcy should take a couple of months.
`` We expect this to be a very short, 30-to-60-day bankruptcy process, during which the company will function normally, '' a top administration official said, `` People will be able to buy cars, they will have their warranties honored, and everything should go on normally. ''
The bankruptcy filing indicated that Chrysler was in debt to 20 creditors to a tune of more than $ 10 million each.
Meanwhile, the deal with Fiat did go through, and Chrysler should have cars designed by Fiat out on the market by 2011.
`` It 's a partnership that will give Chrysler a chance not only to survive, but to thrive in a global auto industry, '' said American president Obama, `` Fiat has demonstrated that it can build the clean, fuel-efficient cars that are the future of the industry. ''
However, automotive analyst Erich Merkle has hesitations.
`` History would show that alliances really do n't work that well, '' Merkle said, `` even though, no matter how good they may look on paper. ''
The restructuring has been managed by Steve Rattner, a former investment banker, and the U.S. Government auto task force.
Obama has set three ultimatums before Fiat.
Fiat should produce a 40 mile per gallon vehicle while managing the new Chrysler, transfer fuel efficient Fiat technology to Chrysler factories in the United States, and produce cars in Chrysler factories and distribute them in Europe.
US automaker GM reports losses of $ 6 billion
May 7, 2009
United States automobile company General Motors announced it has lost US$ 6 billion in the first quarter of 2009, amidst heavy declines in revenues.
Not including special items, the firm said it had lost a net $ 5.9 billion dollars, or $ 9.66 per share.
In the first quarter of last year, GM had reported a loss of $ 381 million, or $ 0.67 per share.
Most financial analysts had forecast the automaker 's losses to be over $ 6.7 billion, or $ 11.05 per share.
GM had also reported that it had spent $ 10.2 billion in an effort to prevent bankruptcy.
The manufacturer has received over $ 15 billion in bailout money from the federal government.
The company has a deadline set at June 1 to draw up a restructuring plan.
If it does n't do so by then, it will be obliged to file for bankruptcy protection.
`` We 're focusing very much on the cost side of the business but once you start losing revenues you get into a vicious circle from which you ca n't recover, '' said Ray Young, the chief financial officer for GM.
`` We continue to see a 60-80 percent chance of a GM bankruptcy.
While the GM equity today is largely uninvestable, we increasingly believe GM may emerge substantially stronger from a bankruptcy - provided the Chapter 11 process is not overly drawn out - particularly given the scope of targeted dealer cuts, '' analyst Himanshu Patel said.
U.S. automaker Chrysler wants to eliminate 789 dealerships
May 14, 2009
American automobile manufacturer Chrysler LLC has said that it wants to eliminate 789, or about a quarter, of its 3,2 dealers by early June.
In a bankruptcy court filing on Thursday, the firm stated its network has too many dealers competing between each other and is antiquated.
A June 3 hearing has been scheduled in the US Bankruptcy Court to determine whether the move should be approved.
`` This is a difficult day for us and not a day anybody can be prepared for, '' said Jim Press, the Vice Chairman of Chrysler.
Company executives said the firm is trying to eliminate dealers with poor performances, and retain those who make the strongest sales.
Over 50 % of the dealerships that are to be eliminated sell less than a hundred automobiles per year.
`` We recognize in the short term we will see some loss of sales.
But based on the long term ... the dealer network ] is key and it 's going to be very strong, powerful, with a much better financial viability, '' said Press.
U.S. automaker GM plans to close 1,1 dealerships
May 15, 2009
American automobile manufacturer General Motors ( GM ) announced plans Friday to shut down about 1,1 of its dealerships, in an effort to evade bankruptcy and lower its expenditures.
GM 's move comes a day after Chrysler, another U.S. car maker, released a list of 789 dealerships that it was closing.
Unlike Chrylser, GM will not publicly announce the dealerships that it intends to shut down.
Instead, dealerships whose franchises wo n't be renewed after October of next year will receive a private letter telling them of the decision.
At the moment, GM has 6,246 dealers in the U.S..
It intends to reduce that number to 3,605 by the end of 2010.
GM said the dealerships that were to be closed are `` underperforming and very small sales volume U.S. dealers. ''
`` They 're dealerships that are in most cases hurting, losing money, and in danger of going out of business anyway, '' said GM 's sales, service, and marketing vice president in a telephone conference.
`` It 's a move that people could argue should have been taken years ago but this leadership team had no choice but to do it today. ''
The dealers that are to be closed represent 18 % of the firm 's dealership network, but only 7 % of GM 's 2008 revenue.
Bankruptcy for U.S. automaker GM becomes almost certain after bondholder offers fail
May 28, 2009
The United States automobile manufacturing firm General Motors announced on Wednesday that most of its bondholders did not exchange GM 's US$ 27 billion debt for a ten percent share in the company 's stock.
The automaker, in financial straits, has a June 1 deadline to finish a government restructuring plan that includes plant closures and other debt reduction measures.
U.S. President Barack Obama 's administration said it would not give more financial aid to the firm unless 90 % of GM 's bondholders would agree on compromises that would significantly reduce the firm 's costs.
`` The principal amount of notes tendered was substantially less than the amount required by GM to satisfy the debt reduction requirement, '' GM said in a statement.
`` They said no.
That 's it.
They tried.
That 's why they 're going to have to file for bankruptcy, '' said a university professor from the University of Michigan who specializes in bankruptcy.
U.S. manufacturer General Motors seeks bankruptcy protection
June 1, 2009
United States automobile manufacturing firm General Motors filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors at 12:00 UTC Monday, in a Manhattan, New York federal bankruptcy court.
This was the largest bankruptcy filing for a U.S. manufacturing company, and with declared assets of $ 82.29 billion and a debt of $ 172.81 billion, and the fourth largest bankruptcy filing in recent U.S. history -- after the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers ( $ 691.06 billion ), Washington Mutual ( $ 327.91 billion ), and WorldCom ( $ 103.91 billion ).
Barack Obama presents rescue plan after GM declaration of bankruptcy
June 1, 2009
In a televised speech from the White House at 16:00 UTC today, President of the United States Barack Obama presented a reorganization plan following the 12:00 UTC announcement by General Motors that it had filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors, the largest bankruptcy of a U.S. manufacturing company.
Describing the problem with the company as one that had been `` decades in the making, '' Obama explained the rationale behind his proposed reorganization plan for General Motors.
He stated that his intent was not to `` perpetuate ] the bad business decisions of the past, '' and that loaning General Motors money, when debt was its problem, would have been doing exactly that.
His plan, he stated, was for the United States government, in conjunction with the governments of Canada and Ontario ( which he thanked for their roles alongside the government of Germany which he thanked for its role in selling a corporate stake in GM Europe ), to become shareholders in General Motors.
The United States government would hold a 60 % stake.
The government will give GM a capital infusion of US$ 30 billion in addition to the funds it has already received.
Of the government ownership he stated that he refused `` to let General Motors and Chrysler become wards of the state '', and described the bankruptcy of Chrysler, and the bankruptcy of General Motors that he envisioned as being `` quick, surgical, bankruptcies ''.
He pointed to the bankruptcy of Chrysler as an example of what he envision for General Motors, but stated that General Motors was a `` more complex company '' than Chrysler.
Responding to challenges voiced by political opponents, before the speech, that the federal government would actively participate in the affairs of the restructured company, he stated that he had `` no interest '' in running GM, and that the federal government would `` refrain from exercising its rights '' as a corporate shareholder for the most part.
In particular, he stated that the federal government would not exercise its rights as a shareholder to dictate `` what new type of car to make. ''
He stated that he expected the restructured GM to make `` high quality, safe, and fuel-efficient cars of tomorrow, '' and several times described what he anticipated as `` better '' and `` fuel-efficient '' cars, after a streamlining of GM 's brands.
He said to the general public that `` I will not pretend that the hard times are over. ''
He described the financial hardship that some -- shareholders, communities based around GM plants, GM dealers, and others -- would undergo as a `` sacrifice for the next generation '' on their parts, so that their children could live in `` an America that still makes things, '' concluding that one day the United States might return to a time when the maxim ( a widely-repeated mis-quotation of what Charles Erwin Wilson once testified before the U.S. Senate when nominated for the position of Secretary of Defense ) would once more be true that `` what is good for General Motors is good for the United States of America. ''
CEO of GM outlines plan for `` New GM '' after auto company declared bankruptcy
June 4, 2009
In a New York press conference at 16:15 UTC, June 1st, Fritz Henderson, the Chief Executive Officer of General Motors, which filed for bankruptcy and Chapter 11 protection from its creditors earlier today, outlined a plan for what he called a `` New GM ''.
Speaking to the press under safe harbor provisions of U.S. law, Henderson described the events of today as a `` defining moment '' in the history of General Motors.
Speaking to the public he said that `` The GM that let you down is history, '' and described a `` New GM '' that he expected to result from the bankruptcy process.
Henderson stated that he envisioned the bankruptcy process would take between 60 and 90 days.
He stressed several times his view that the process would be one that is executed quickly, saying that not just a sense of urgency but `` pure unadulterated speed '' was his expectation of the process.
He emphasized that `` GM remains open for business '' during the bankruptcy period, continuing to sell and to support its products, and that day one motions had been filed in the bankruptcy court in order to allow this.
Regarding the bankruptcy process he said, `` We will do it right.
And we will do it once. ''
He stated that the plan for General Motors had the support of the United Auto Workers union, the Canadian Auto Workers union, the GM VEBA, and a majority of the unsecured bondholders of GM.
He also mentioned that GM had already received $ 1.5 million in bridge financing from the German government.
In response to questions about the possibility of the United States federal government, a majority shareholder in the restructured company, dictating future product development and strategy, such as the sale of more fuel-efficient and green vehicles ";" he first observed that the federal government had already stated to him that it had `` no real interest in running our business '' and that he expected that still to be his job.
Of the specific hypothetical scenario where the management of GM wants to make one type of car, because it thinks that it is the right thing for the business, and the U.S. government wants to make another type of car, he stated that `` I do n't think it 's going to happen. ''
Expanding on that point he stated that he expected the `` New GM '' to focus upon `` highly fuel-efficient and green technology '', and that operating both in accordance with U.S. environmental laws and in response to customer demand would naturally result in the New GM producing the types of vehicles that the U.S. government would encourage.
The `` New GM '' he also expected to focus on `` four core brands '', and will size its dealership to match that.
He stated that GM would offer a `` deferred termination '' package to dealers, to allow them to cease dealing in GM vehicles in a managed and gradual way.
He stated that the bankruptcy filings did not cover General Motors ' businesses in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific.
Of GM 's profitable ventures in China, specifically, he stated that they were `` a critical part of the New GM ''.
In response to questions of whether the New GM would import cars from China to the U.S., he stated the formative company 's core principle that `` We build where we sell '' applied in both directions, with GM building in China to sell in China and building in the U.S. to sell in the U.S., stating that this shortened supply chains.
He declined to predict when the New GM would return to profitability, stating that the goal was rather to lower the break-even EBIT point for the company.
He also declined to speculate upon when the U.S. government would sell its stake in the company, saying that that was a question `` better addressed to the U.S. Treasury '', and merely saying that he expected it to be `` years, not months '' when the U.S. Treasury felt it would give `` the right return for taxpayers. ''
Penske Auto selected to buy General Motors ' Saturn unit
June 5, 2009
General Motors Corporation ( GM ), an American automaker which has filed for bankruptcy protection, announced on Friday that the Penske Automotive Group ( PAG ) was selected to purchase Saturn Corporation.
The transaction should be completed in October.
The purchase includes rights to the Saturn brand, its five current models and its dealership network.
Two models would be discontinued, the Sky and Astra.
GM would continue building the Aura sedan, the SUV 's, Vue and Outlook for at least two more years.
Saturn has 350 dealers across the United States.
The dealers employ more than 13 jobs and sell only the Saturn autos.
Canadian Saturn dealers are not included in the deal.
According to Penske future Saturn vehicles will be fuel economy focused.
An expert indicated that this would move Saturn back to its roots of a entry level car company.
PAG is in talks with several international automakers to replace GM after 2011.
Automotive News reports that Renault Samsung Motors of Korea is the most likely candidate.
Penske wants Jill Lajdziak, Saturn 's general manager, and Tom LaSorda, former Chrysler President to head up the company when it is independent of GM.
Serra Automotive in Grand Blanc Township, Genesee County, Michigan, is in talks to take a partial ownership in a new Saturn lead by Penske.
Automobile manufacturer Ford posts unexpected profits
November 3, 2009
The US automobile manufacturer Ford has said that it posted a net profit of US$ 997 million in the third quarter of this year, and predicted that it would be `` solidly profitable '' by 2011.
The reports surprised most analysts, who had forecast that the auto company would lose money.
Ford 's profits equate to 26 cents per share, a large difference to the 12 cent per share lost that had been anticipated by most economic analysts.
`` Our third-quarter results clearly show Ford is making tremendous progress despite the prolonged economic slump, '' said the firm 's chief executive officer, Alan Mulally.
`` While we still face a challenging road ahead, our transformation is working and our underlying business continues to grow stronger. ''
Mulally predicted that his company would meet or even surpass all of its financial targets, and suggested that the fourth quarter of this year could see it post an operating profit.
Automaker GM to cut 10 jobs at Opel
November 5, 2009
The US car manufacturer General Motors said that it would axe 10 jobs at its European division, Opel.
According to the company 's vice president John Smith, the firm wanted to reduce costs at Opel by 30 %.
Smith announced the company 's move on Wednesday.
He did n't say where the cuts were going to take place, but wanted to present details of the plan to European governments `` very soon ''.
A day before the announcement, GM said it was cancelling a deal to sell Opel to Magna, a Canadian automobile parts company.
Politicians in Germany expressed disappointment at GM 's cancellation of the Magna deal, which the country 's government had favoured.
`` GM 's ] behaviour towards Germany is completely unacceptable, '' said German economy minister Rainer Bruederle.
The premier of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia remarked that `` General Motors ' behaviour shows the ugly face of turbo-capitalism.
That is completely unacceptable. ''
The UK government, however, welcomed the firm 's decision.
`` It is the best decision for Britain and our plants, '' said the general secretary of the British union Unite, Tony Woodley.
`` I am absolutely delighted that General Motors have finally done the right thing for them and for us, '' he told the BBC.

Ford Motors posts US$ 2.7 billion annual profit
January 28, 2010
Ford Motors Co., the automobile manufacturing firm, has posted an annual profit for the last year of US$ 2.7 billion, the first gain for four years.
The statistics are an improvement from 2008, when the car company posted a loss of close to $ 15 billion.
For the final quarter of 2009, Ford says it made profits of $ 868 million, and expects to continue to be profitable this year.
The company had cut its costs to $ 118.3 billion last year, $ 19.8 billion than the year previous.
Ford had a $ 34.3 billion debt at the end of 2009.
In the fourth quarter, Ford brand sales were up thirteen percent compared to the same time in 2008 in the US, and obtained 15.3 % of the automobile market in the country.
The firm 's president and chief executive, Alan Mulally, commented on the profits.
`` While we still face significant challenges ahead, 2009 was a pivotal year for Ford and the strongest proof yet that our One Ford plan is working and that we are forging a path toward profitable growth, '' he said, adding that `` global economic conditions are reviving but remain fragile. ''
Ford 's US auto sales spike, surpassing GM
March 3, 2010
Ford Motor Company said on Tuesday that its sales in the United States rose 43 % in February compared to the same period last year, as the automaker outsold rivals Toyota and General Motors.
Ford said that total sales improved to 142,285 units, compared to 141,951 units sold by GM.
Additionally, Ford said that its share of the total US car market rose to 17 %, up from 14 % a year ago.
The increase was better than analysts had predicted, and Ford 's stock rose to a five-year high in morning trading, before declining later in the day.
Ford 's sales were significantly influenced by a 74 % increase in fleet sales to businesses.
Rental car agencies alone accounted for around 30 units sold.
Sales to retail consumers increased only 28 %.
The increases were led by sales of two sedans, the Fusion and Taurus, which rose 166.5 and 93.3 % respectively, although sales of other models such as SUVs and pickup trucks also increased.
Both models were significantly redesigned last year, and analysts said that improved quality from such cars were driving the increases.
Other companies also reported February sales today, nearly all reporting sales gains as well, although none as large as those of Ford.
Toyota was the sole exception to the sales gains, as their sales declined 8.7 %, as the company was faced with a global recall during the month that led to a temporary stoppage of production for some models.
`` The strength of our new products ... are resonating with customers, '' said Ken Czubay, Ford 's vice president of sales and marketing.
However, he believed that traditional Toyota customers were not buying rival autos, but rather awaiting the results from the recalls.
Fiat plans to buy majority stake in Chrysler
May 29, 2011
Fiat announced on Friday that it intends to purchase the six percent of automaker Chrysler that the US government currently owns, which would give the Italian company a 52 percent majority stake in Chrysler.
According to Fiat 's announcement, the company has told the US Treasury that it intends to use its option to buy the share in Chrysler held by the US government, a deal that will be finalized by June 10.
If a price is not agreed on by that time, Fiat will pay the average of the estimates of two investment banks.
In 2009, Fiat bought a twenty percent stake in Chrysler, which had just exited bankruptcy, and has since increased its holding to 46 percent, expected to increase to 57 % by the end of this year.
According to analyst Maryann Keller, the deal is a good one for both companies, as `` n ] either one has the ability to compete alone in the kind of global environment that they face. ''
Analyst Rebecca Lindland said that the move will also benefit the companies by getting `` them out from underneath any hint of government ownership and any of that negativity that went along with the bailout. ''
Ford Motor Company cutting 30 jobs by 2012
January 23, 2006
The Ford Motor Company, the second-largest car manufacturer in America, will cut 30 jobs and 14 plants as part of a restructuring plan to relieve Ford after a US$ 1.6 billion loss last year in North American sales.
The plan, called `` Way Forward '', the brainchild of Ford 's Chief Executive Officer, William Clay Ford Jr., is to end Ford 's North American losses by 2008.
To accomplish this 30 jobs which make up 20 to 25 percent of Ford 's North American workforce of 122 people will be cut and 14 plants will be closed in order to bring Ford 's production capacity in line with demand.
By the end of this year, the Atlanta and St. Louis plants will be closed.
Atlanta makes the Ford Taurus sedan, which is being phased out.
The St. Louis plant is one of two plants that manufactures the Ford Explorer, whose sales had a 29 % decline in 2005.
It will also close its Wixom, Michigan plant, Batavia Transmission in Ohio the Windsor Casting plant in Ontario which was previously announced by Ford that it was to be closed after contract negotiations with the Canadian Auto Workers union.
The plant in St. Thomas, Ontario plant will have one shift cut from it.
The plant makes the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis cars.
On this cut of the one shift, Whitey MacDonald, chairperson of Local 1520, Canadian Auto Workers union said `` There is a lot of anger here today, there is no doubt about it.
Any time a plant goes to one shift, it puts them in limbo.
This car has made the company millions of dollars over the years they have invested in other products and locations - we are entitled to some new investment given our track record. ''
Positive news for the plant is that Ford is still committed to invest $ 200 million into the plant to upgrade the appearance of the two cars manufactured there.
On the contrary, according to Automotive analyst Dennis DesRosier believes that the factory is still `` likely '' to close.
DesRoiser said, `` The St. Thomas plant is old, the product is old, it make sense it is on that list.
This may be just a short-term reprieve, it may be look at permanent closure in two to three years. ''
Two more plants will close in 2008, another two in 2012.
Two more plants to be closed are to be announced later this year.
Also, Ford will fire 12 % of its 53 executive officers.
Due to the company 's current contract with the United Auto Workers union, workers at the idled plants will still be receiving their pay and benefits until Ford negotiates a new contract with the union.
However, the workers may not earn what they earn today because they will not be eligible for overtime.
The UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Gerald Bantom called say the plan is `` extremely disappointing. ''
The UAW issued statement saying `` The impacted hourly and salaried workers find themselves facing uncertain futures because of senior management 's failure to halt Ford 's sliding market share.
The announcement has further left a cloud hanging over the entire work force because of pending future announcements of additional facilities to be closed at some point in the future. ''
GM posts first annual loss since 1992
January 27, 2006
General Motors logo.
General Motors Corporation ( GM ) has posted its first annual loss since 1992.
GM reported losing US$ 4.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005 and a total loss of $ 8.6 billion for the entire year.
GM admitted Thursday night that the loss could swell further as it pays pensions and healthcare costs to thousands of former workers.
GM warned that the amount calculated for last year is preliminary and could rise before it is officially reported to the US securities and exchanges commission in March.
The loss was far greater than analysts predicted.
Ford, the second of the big three American car manufacturers, beat predictions earlier in the week.
In contrast, Toyota is expected to report that it will beat last year 's profit of $ 11 billion.
GM 's automotive division lost $ 1.5 billion in the fourth quarter, driven by losses in North America.
This has been attributed to GM 's shrinking market share, which has been taken by Japanese manufacturers Toyota and Nissan.
A further $ 1.3 billion was lost in restructuring charges.
As part of the restructure, GM plans to cut 30 jobs and close 12 facilities by 2008.
An aide for Kirk Kerkorian, GMs largest individual investor ( at 9.9 % ), has called on the company to halve its $ 1.1 billion annual dividend, cut executive pay and sell Saab.
Australian government announces $ 52.5 million financial assistance package for Ford
May 5, 2006
Australian Prime Minister John Howard and federal industry minister Ian MacDonald today announced that the federal government would be providing Ford Australia with a AU$ 52.5 million ( US$ 40.4 million ) `` financial assistance package ''.
Additional assistance will also be provided by the Victorian state government.
According to Mr Howard, the injection will secure Ford 's manufacturing operations in Australia `` for the long term ''.
From the package, AU$ 40 million will be used for the design and manufacture of Ford 's next model Falcon and Territory vehicles, which will be built in Australia.
Despite being given a major facelift in 2002 and another in 2005, the Falcon 's bodyshell dates back to 1998.
The current Falcon will need to serve the company until at least 2007 when the new model is anticipated.
In the meantime, it will face stiff competition from the completely new Holden Commodore ( the Falcon 's major competitor ) which will be released in the second half of this year.
The additional AU$ 12.5 million will be spent on the development of a light commercial vehicle platform, which will be built overseas and marketed to around 80 countries.
Mr Howard said that the light commercial project would involve construction of a research and development centre, which will become the base for R&D projects in the region.
Mr MacFarlane said that the research facility was exciting for Australia and that it would put the Australian automotive in the spotlight.
`` The funding has helped Ford Australia secure the largest automotive R&D project ever undertaken in Australia which is equally exciting news for local Ford employees and Australian component producers '' he said.
`` The project will see Ford Australia become a centre for automotive design and engineering excellence in the Asia Pacific region which will bring spin-off benefits for the broader industry, '' `` This opportunity will put both Ford Australia, and the Australian automotive and components sectors on the world map as far as our automotive design and engineering capabilities are concerned. ''
Mr MacFarlane said.
Mr Howard claims that the projects will create 273 jobs and secure the future of the `` iconic '' Ford Falcon, which has been built in Australia since 1960.
The financial package is conditional upon Ford Australia giving the Australian automotive component industry an opportunity to supply components for the vehicles produced by the two projects.
Ford announces deep production cuts in response to growing losses
August 19, 2006
Ford has announced sweeping cuts of 21 % ( 168 units ) in its US and Canadian production, resulting in the partial closure of ten of its plants during the fourth quarter.
The measure comes on top of existing turnaround plans announced in January, in which 25 to 30 positions should be cut and 14 plants closed by 2012.
Ford is the world 's third-largest automaker and the U.S. 's second-largest.
However it has in recent years been struggling with poor profitability and shrinking market shares.
In 2005 it lost $ 1.6 billion and recently the company reported a second quarter loss of $ 254 million and a 34 % year-year decline in sales for the month of July.
George Pipas, director of sales analysis at Ford, points to rising gas prices having negative impact on the sale of the companies SUV lines as well as its sales leader, the F-series pickup truck as being the direct cause of the latest initiative.
So far the following plants are thought to be affected : * St. Thomas Assembly of St. Thomas, Ontario, Canada * Chicago, Illinois * Wixom Assembly Plant of Wixom, Michigan, Michigan * Louisville Assembly of Louisville, Kentucky * Michigan Truck Plant of Wayne, Michigan * St. Paul, Minnesota * Kansas City Assembly of Kansas City, Missouri * Norfolk Assembly of Norfolk, Virginia * River Rouge Plant of Dearborn, Michigan Ford 's stock fell 17 cents ( 2.1 % ) to $ 8 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Ford Taurus to be revived
February 9, 2007
thumb Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally has reported that Ford will rename the Ford Five Hundred to the Taurus for the 2008 model year, when a facelifted model is expected to be launched to improve the lackluster sales of the outgoing model.
Mulally says that Ford 's decision to name all their cars with the letter F was a lackluster move, and makes their names easily forgettable.
As a result, Mulally plans on reviving many respected Ford nameplates, the Taurus being one of them, and the Falcon possibly in the future.
The Ford Taurus was originally introduced in 1986, and was a revolutionary car that rewrote the rules for creating a sedan, and pushed the other American automakers to follow suit, leading to a design revolution that completely rid Detroit of the `` boxy '' cars of the 70s and 80s.
The Taurus survived for four generations, selling over 7,500,000 units.
The Taurus was discontinued in October 2006, after a brief run of 2007 models destined for fleet customers.
`` How can it go away ? ''
Alan Mulally remembered asking, `` It 's the best-selling car in America. ''
While it is not expected for the name change to turn the Five Hundred into a 400 plus units a year blockbuster like the Taurus, it is expected to make sales more solid, and to make the car well known, since the Taurus is a well known nameplate around the country.

February 14, 2007
International car company DaimlerChrysler announced today it would cut 13 jobs in North America.

It also plans to cut two Chrysler plants in an attempt to make Chrysler business profitable by 2008.
About 9 production jobs will be cut in the U.S., 2 production jobs in Canada, and 2 salaried jobs.
`` It 's hard to say if it 's enough ... but the stock is reacting nicely, which is further verification that this is a favorable restructuring move and a much-needed one at Chrysler, '' said chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, Tim Ghriskey.
Following some speculation that the companies Daimler-Benz ( Mercedes-Benz ) and Chrysler, which merged together in 1998 to make DaimlerChrysler, would split, chairman Dieter Zetsche denied allegations.
`` We do not exclude any option in order to find the best solution for both the Chrysler Group and DaimlerChrysler. ''

Ford offers US$ 78 million for Romanian auto plant
September 8, 2007
Ford Motor Company, the U.S. car maker, will reportedly pay $ 57 million ( US$ 78 million ) for a 72.4 percent stake in the Romanian assembly plant Automobile Craiova, a Romanian official said Friday.
`` The offer of Ford Motor Company for a 72.4 percent stake is $ 4.1556 per share or $ 57 million overall, '' said Sebastian Vladescu, head of the State Property Agency ( AVAS ), after opening Ford 's improved offer.
Vladescu added that the contract may be signed on September 12, during the auto show in Frankfurt.
The Romanian government bought back the Craiova-based car maker from Daewoo Motors, in late 2006 for US$ 51 million.
As the Korean company was bankrupt, the government had to pay another $ 10 million for debts stemming from past loans.
Ford is the only bidder for the purchase of the factory.
According to Washington Post, many auto-part makers have set up in the new European Union member country, attracted by cheap labor, favourable tax rates and the rising output of Renault 's Dacia plant.
The vice president of Dacia, Constantin Stroe, said that the price Ford offers is not important.
`` It 's important to have the factory working as soon as possible '', he added.
`` With this production facility, Romania will become an important auto production center in Europe '', concluded Stroe, cited by HotNews.
